Into the Sky.\n3 Shots Fired. 15 Retired.\nShells to the Ground. Makes a Sound.\nI Now hold… Deep Deep Down.\n\n**Chorus** \n*15 Shells and a Wall Of Stone. Locked inside but Not Alone.\nShells to the Ground. Now A Sound. That I Hold Dear… Deep Deep Down.*\n\n**Bridge**\nLast In the Row… A Bugle Blows.\nTaps an Echo… Tears Now Flow.\nAll is Silent… We Stand Alone.\nNot your Home… This Tall Wall of Stone.\n\nIt's Later Now… Hard to Believe.\nFew Know How… These Shells Remind Me.\nI am your Son… and Proud To Be.\nI am your Son… Yeah This is Me.",
